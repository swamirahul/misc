Given a string str containing alphanumeric characters, calculate sum of all numbers present in the string.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains a string containing alphanumeric characters.

Output:
Print the sum of all numbers present in the string.

Constraints:
1<=T<=105
1<=length of the string<=105

Example:
Input:
4
1abc23
geeks4geeks
1abc2x30yz67
123abc

Output:
24
4
100
123

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 1 and 23 are numbers in the string which is added to get the sum as 24.
Testcase 4: 123 is a single number, so sum is 123.
#code
for i in range(int(input())):
    string = str(input())
    sum = 0
    aux = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        try:
            aux = aux*10 + int(string[i])
        except:
            sum = sum+aux
            aux = 0
            continue
    sum = sum+aux
    print(sum)
